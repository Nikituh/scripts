# Basic script that analyzes the message counts of a single chat from a downloaded facebook archive
# The script must be in the same folder as your unpacked archive folder

# To download your archive, click on Settings (dropdown in your top-right corner),
# then 'Download a copy of your Facebook data.'
# Your entire facebook history is parsed together into a full offline web page,
# containing .html files of everything you've ever said and done
# This operation might take some time, my archive's eventual size was 2.8gb
